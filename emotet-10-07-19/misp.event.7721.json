Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1204) to gain execution.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.","galaxy_id":"2","source":"https:\/\/github.com\/mitre\/cti","authors":["MITRE"],"version":"9","uuid":"6aac77c4-eaf2-4366-8c13-ce50ab951f38","tag_id":"562","meta":{"external_id":["CAPEC-163"],"kill_chain":["mitre-attack:initial-access"],"mitre_data_sources":["File monitoring","Packet capture","Network intrusion detection system","Detonation chamber","Email gateway","Mail server"],"mitre_platforms":["Windows","macOS","Linux"],"refs":["https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1193","https:\/\/capec.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/163.html"]},"local":false},{"id":"6071","collection_uuid":"dcb864dc-775f-11e7-9fbb-1f41b4996683","type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Command-Line Interface - T1059","tag_name":"misp-galaxy:mitre-attack-pattern=\"Command-Line Interface - T1059\"","description":"Command-line interfaces provide a way of interacting with computer systems and is a common feature across many types of operating system platforms.

Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources.

Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and PowerShell but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.\n\nScripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in [Spearphishing Attachment](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1193) and other types of spearphishing are opened.

Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system\/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n\n### Windows\n\nThere are multiple approaches to injecting code into a live process. Windows implementations include: (Citation: Endgame Process Injection July 2017)\n\n* **Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection** involves writing the path to a malicious DLL inside a process then invoking execution by creating a remote thread.\n* **Portable executable injection** involves writing malicious code directly into the process (without a file on disk) then invoking execution with either additional code or by creating a remote thread. The displacement of the injected code introduces the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references. Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue. (Citation: Endgame HuntingNMemory June 2017)\n* **Thread execution hijacking** involves injecting malicious code or the path to a DLL into a thread of a process. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1093), the thread must first be suspended.\n* **Asynchronous Procedure Call** (APC) injection involves attaching malicious code to the APC Queue (Citation: Microsoft APC) of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A variation of APC injection, dubbed \"Early Bird injection\", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC. (Citation: CyberBit Early Bird Apr 2018)  AtomBombing  (Citation: ENSIL AtomBombing Oct 2016) is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table. (Citation: Microsoft Atom Table)\n* **Thread Local Storage** (TLS) callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. (Citation: FireEye TLS Nov 2017)\n\n### Mac and Linux\n\nImplementations for Linux and OS X\/macOS systems include: (Citation: Datawire Code Injection) (Citation: Uninformed Needle)\n\n* **LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH** (Linux), **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (Mac OS X) environment variables, or the dlfcn application programming interface (API) can be used to dynamically load a library (shared object) in a process which can be used to intercept API calls from the running process. (Citation: Phrack halfdead 1997)\n* **Ptrace system calls** can be used to attach to a running process and modify it in runtime. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)\n* **\/proc\/[pid]\/mem** provides access to the memory of the process and can be used to read\/write arbitrary data to it. This technique is very rare due to its complexity. (Citation: Uninformed Needle)\n* **VDSO hijacking** performs runtime injection on ELF binaries by manipulating code stubs mapped in from the linux-vdso.so shared object. (Citation: VDSO hijack 2009)\n\nMalware commonly utilizes process injection to access system resources through which Persistence and other environment modifications can be made. More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.","galaxy_id":"2","source":"https:\/\/github.com\/mitre\/cti","authors":["MITRE"],"version":"9","uuid":"43e7dc91-05b2-474c-b9ac-2ed4fe101f4d","tag_id":"436","meta":{"external_id":["CAPEC-242"],"kill_chain":["mitre-attack:defense-evasion","mitre-attack:privilege-escalation"],"mitre_data_sources":["API monitoring","Windows Registry","File monitoring","DLL monitoring","Process monitoring","Named Pipes"],"mitre_platforms":["Linux","macOS","Windows"],"refs":["https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/techniques\/T1055","https:\/\/capec.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/242.html","https:\/\/github.com\/mattifestation\/PowerSploit","https:\/\/www.endgame.com\/blog\/technical-blog\/hunting-memory","https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/windows\/desktop\/ms681951.aspx","https:\/\/blog.ensilo.com\/atombombing-brand-new-code-injection-for-windows","https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/library\/windows\/desktop\/ms649053.aspx","https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/sysinternals\/downloads\/sysmon","https:\/\/www.fireeye.com\/blog\/threat-research\/2017\/11\/ursnif-variant-malicious-tls-callback-technique.html","https:\/\/www.datawire.io\/code-injection-on-linux-and-macos\/","http:\/\/hick.org\/code\/skape\/papers\/needle.txt","http:\/\/phrack.org\/issues\/51\/8.html","http:\/\/vxer.org\/lib\/vrn00.html","https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/acct\/","https:\/\/access.redhat.com\/documentation\/red_hat_enterprise_linux\/6\/html\/security_guide\/chap-system_auditing","http:\/\/www.chokepoint.net\/2014\/02\/detecting-userland-preload-rootkits.html","https:\/\/www.cyberbit.com\/blog\/endpoint-security\/new-early-bird-code-injection-technique-discovered\/","https:\/\/www.endgame.com\/blog\/technical-blog\/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process"]},"local":false},{"id":"6134","collection_uuid":"dcb864dc-775f-11e7-9fbb-1f41b4996683","type":"mitre-attack-pattern","value":"Account Discovery - T1087","tag_name":"misp-galaxy:mitre-attack-pattern=\"Account Discovery - T1087\"","description":"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain accounts. \n\n### Windows\n\nExample commands that can acquire this information are <code>net user<\/code>, <code>net group <groupname><\/code>, and <code>net localgroup <groupname><\/code> using the [Net](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0039) utility or through use of [dsquery](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/software\/S0105).
